		<p>I am an assistant professor of Remote Sensing at Soran University. I use Python, R, and Javascript programming languages, 
    remote sensing and GIS methods and techniques to study LST, urban environment, earth observation, and natural disasters.
Driven by a passion for understanding global and local environmental issues, I bring over 16 years of experience in remote sensing, GIS, and programming to my research and teaching. I hold a PhD in Geography from University of Leicester and have published over 50 peer-reviewed articles in journals like The Lancet and The Lancet Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>
At Soran University, I serve as an Assistant Professor, specializing in teaching and mentoring students in remote sensing and GIS. Additionally, I collaborate on research with the Global Burden of Disease at IHME (UW). I hold certifications in forest mapping and air pollution monitoring from NASA. Moreover, I instruct e-learning courses in Python and R programming.</p>

<p>Seeking new opportunities in academia or industry that align with my expertise and mission to advance environmental knowledge and solutions.</p>
